Your center of gravity shifts constantly - anticipate this by feeling the gear's tension points\n2. Never look at your anchors - your body should know where they are instinctively\n3. The kill comes from your hips, not your arms - twist your torso for maximum blade velocity\n\nWhen Eren and I were trapped in Trost district, these techniques allowed me to eliminate 11 titans in succession without\nneeding to refill my gas. Remember - hesitation leads to death. Your body knows what to do before your mind does.''',

Weight Discrepancy - A 15-meter titan should weigh ~100 tons, but their footsteps suggest <5 tons\n2. Thermal Nullification - They generate no body heat despite constant muscle activity\n3. Photosynthetic Traits - Their skin shows chloroplast-like structures yet they consume humans\n4. Instant Vaporization - Upon death, they disappear completely within 13 seconds\n5. Neural Network - No central brain, yet coordinated movement suggests distributed intelligence\n6. Selective Digestion - They ignore most animals, specifically targeting humans\n7. The Coordinate - How some can control others remains completely unexplained\n\nMoblit always warned me about getting too close... but how could I resist such fascinating creatures?\nEvery answer just leads to more questions!''',

Every time I feel the wool against my skin, I remember:\n• The boy who fought human traffickers for a stranger\n• The determination in his eyes when he said "I'll wrap it around you as many times as you want"\n• The promise that I would never be alone again\n\nThat's why I protect him. Not because of blood or duty, but because the world needs people like Eren; people who fight for others without hesitation. Even if he's lost his way... I still believe in that boy.''',
